* v1.16, Saturday, February 19, 2005

   Switch during launch if we are launching anyway.  More efficient.

* v1.15, Monday, December 7, 2004

   warn, don't die, if app path cannot be found, because we might
   succeed anyway (if LaunchServices DB not updated for some reason,
   and app is open).

* v1.14, Tuesday, June 8, 2004

   Use Mac::Apps::Launch once again for launching apps.

* v1.13, Tuesday, May 18, 2004

   Handle launching and $SWITCHing of applications by bundle ID
   (previously only worked for app signatures).

* v1.12, Monday, May 10, 2004

   Eliminate a bunch of memory leaks, where we didn't dipose of AEDescs
   or Handles.

   No longer automatically populate EVENT and REPLY keys with AEPrint results.
   We fixed the memory leak in it, I think, but it was still an awful lot of
   data to lug around for no good reason.

* v1.11, Wednesday, February 18, 2004

   Added typeComp (coerce to float).

   Added typeLongDateTime (convert to/from Mac OS); added Time::Epoch.
   (Lars Eggert)

* v1.10, Wednesday, November 19, 2003

   Fixed $^E bug in perl 5.8.x (and make $^E handling more robust).

   Changed pack_pid() to use actual PID instead of converting to PSN,
   using typeKernelProcessID instead of typeProcessSerialNumber.


* v1.09, Sunday, November 2, 2003

   Oops, spelled URI "URL" in Makefile.PL.


* v1.08, Friday, October 31, 2003

   Added pack_eppc_x() for creating a target to an application on
   a remote computer, for Mac OS X.  Basic syntax:
   
       $target = pack_eppc_x('Finder', 'mac.example.com');


* v1.07, Wednesday, October 29, 2003

   Fixed qdrt to put elements in correct order.


* v1.06, Tuesday, June 24, 2003

   Checked that $ENUMREC is defined.


* v1.05, Thursday, May 22, 2003

   Added typeLongDateTime to AE_GET.

   Used Mac::Errors for internal errors.

   Added t/pod.t.


* v1.04, Monday, May 12, 2003

   Fix a test, update Makefile.PL.


* v1.03, Monday, April 14, 2003

   Updated tests and notes, and require more recent Mac::Carbon,
   for Mac OS X support.

   Added pack_pid, to target applications by PID instead of signature,
   PPC location, or PSN (Mac OS X only).
   

* v1.02, Tuesday, May 7, 2002

   Fix typo in Makefile.PL.


* v1.01, Monday, January 14, 2002

   Make _getdata smarter.

   Added utxt coercion to text.  Catch errors in coercion.

   Change license to be that of Perl.


* v1.00, Monday, September 11, 2000

   Added handle_event function.

   Use cluck from the Carp module if available if $WARN is greater
   than 1 (fall back to carp if cluck not available).


* v0.81, Tuesday, November 2, 1999

   Added requirement for Mac::AppleEvents version 1.22
   (included in distribution).

   Added type method.

   Added EPPC addressing (Apple events over TCP/IP).  Seems to work
   as well as the PPC addressing.  Requires Mac OS 9.  Added
   pack_eppc.


* v0.80, Friday, September 10, 1999

   Added PPC port addressing.  Still experimental, as I am working largely
   off empirical observation, rather than specs.  Added pack_ppc.
   (Cameron Ashby <cameron@evolution.com>)

   Added pack_psn to simply get a PSN into a long double.


* v0.72, Wednesday, September 1, 1999

   Fixed bug in _event_error that did not return proper value,
   or clear $^E properly.  (Francis Clarke <F.Clarke@swansea.ac.uk>)


* v0.71, Tuesday, June 8, 1999

   Added $DEBUG global.  Will be used more.

   Added some coercions so certain types will be returned as typeChar
   from the get method.


* v0.70, Friday, June 4, 1999

   Removed deprecated ae_send function.  Use send_event instead.

   Removed deprecated get_text function.  Not needed anymore, use get
   method instead.

   Cleaned up stuff.

   Improved error handling.  Will return on first error.  See docs above
   for more information.

   Made $Mac::AppleEvents::Simple::SWITCH 0 by default instead of 1.

   Added global %DESCS to save AEDescs for disposal later.


* v0.65, May 30, 1999

   No longer return entire desc from get if direct object not supplied.

   Error number put in $^E if supplied.

   Added a bunch of stuff to %AE_GET.

   get method now automatically unpacks nested AE records and AE lists into
   perl hash and array references.


* v0.61, May 1, 1999

   Made default timeout kNoTimeOut.

   Changed use of REPLY for parameter to AESend to GETREPLY.
   REPLY was already in use, D'oh!


* v0.60, January 28, 1999

   Added get and data methods.


* v0.52, September 30, 1998

   Re-upload, sigh.


* v0.51, September 29, 1998

   Fixed problems accepting parameters in send_event.  Sped up
   switching routine significantly.


* v0.50, September 16, 1998

   Only LaunchApps when sending event now if $SWITCH is nonzero or
   app is not already running.

   Added warnings for event errors if present and if $^W is nonzero.
   Only works if event errors use standard keywords errs or errn.


* v0.10, June 2, 1998

   Changed new to build_event, and ae_send to send_event.

   Made default AESend parameters overridable via send_event.


* v0.03, June 1, 1998

   Added $SWITCH global var to override making target app go to front.


* v0.02, May 19, 1998

   Here goes ...
